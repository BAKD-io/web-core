                                If you participate in these kind of bounties you will receive a fixed amount of BAKD Coins as your reward. In order to receive your BAKD Coins, your claim must be completed and approved before that particular bounty's reward supply is exceeded.

                                If you participate in these kind of bounties you will receive what are called "stakes" upon completing a bounty. These stakes represent a dynamic share in the prize pool of coins for a particular bounty. While the end reward will be paid in BAKD Coins, it ultimately depends on the following factors:
                                <ol style="font-size: 14px;">
                                    <li>
                                        1.) The total number of stakes you accumulate for a particular bounty.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        2.) The total number of stakes accumulated for a particular bounty, by all members involved.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        3.) The size of the BAKD Coins Prize Pool for a particular bounty.
                                    </li>
                                </ol>

                                    Example: You have 5 stakes of a specific bounty, at the end of the bounty there are a total of 100 stakes distributed, you then receive 5% of the <strong>total</strong> reward pool for this specific bounty!
